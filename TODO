* allow pulling in movePiece (maybe give also last step as argument)
* add functionality for takeback and undo as special steps
* add special step when capturing pieces (ex.: Rc3x), should be easy in removeTrappedPieces()
* implement updatePossibleMoves (pushing, pulling is missing, needs fixing maybe)
* implement game end

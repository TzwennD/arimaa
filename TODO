* allow pulling in movePiece (maybe give also last step as argument)
* add functionality for end, resign and takeback as special steps (at the moment, not less than 4 steps are possible)
* add special step when capturing pieces (ex.: Rc3x), should be easy in removeTrappedPieces()
* implement updatePossibleMoves (pushing, pulling is missing, needs fixing maybe)
